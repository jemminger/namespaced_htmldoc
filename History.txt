2010-12-21:
* Forked from github.com/craigw/htmldoc
* Only the main code and tests were updated; it is likely that the Rakefile is
  now invalid/broken.

* The htmldoc command sometimes uses \r in the output. [Jon Wood]

0.2.2
* Move source code to GitHub: http://github.com/craigw/htmldoc
* Strings that have linebreaks in are probably not URLs.
* If a string has a line starting what matches /https?:\/\/ it's not an 
  URL, it's a string. [Tim Peters <http://rubyforge.org/users/tcp>]
